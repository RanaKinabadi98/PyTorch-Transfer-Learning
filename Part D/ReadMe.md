# Part D: Regularization Techniques
## Description:
Integrate regularization techniques into the model training process to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. Examples include dropout, weight decay, or label smoothing.

## Steps:

- Implement a regularization method of your choice in the training code.
- Train the model and observe changes in performance.
- Analyze and record the results.
