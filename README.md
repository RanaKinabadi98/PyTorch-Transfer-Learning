This project investigates the power of transfer learning in performing image classification tasks with PyTorch.
# Image Classification with Transfer Learning  

This project demonstrates image classification using transfer learning techniques in PyTorch. The main focus is to explore the performance of different augmentations, models, and regularization techniques.  

## Objectives  
1. Run the initial example from the [LearnOpenCV tutorial](https://learnopencv.com/image-classification-using-transfer-learning-in-pytorch/).  
2. Experiment with additional augmentations and analyze their effects.  
3. Swap the model architecture from ResNet to EfficientNet and evaluate performance.  
4. Introduce custom regularization techniques and assess the results.
