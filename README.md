# PyTorch-Transfer-Learning
This project investigates the power of transfer learning in performing image classification tasks with PyTorch.
It starts with a baseline model and then incorporates advanced techniques, including data augmentation, model architecture modifications-such as ResNet to EfficientNet-and regularization methods. It aims at improving the classification performance and thus providing a comprehensive comparison between these techniques based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
