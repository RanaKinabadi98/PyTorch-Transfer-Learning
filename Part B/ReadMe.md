# Part B: Augmentation Techniques
## Description:

Explore additional augmentation techniques beyond those provided in the original example. Apply these augmentations to the dataset to improve the model's robustness.

## Steps:

- Identify new augmentation methods (e.g., color jitter, scaling, flipping).

- Implement these techniques in the data preprocessing pipeline.

- Evaluate and compare the modelâ€™s performance with and without these augmentations.
