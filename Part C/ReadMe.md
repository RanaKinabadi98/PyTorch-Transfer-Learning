# Part C: Model Architecture Change

## Description:
Replace the default model (ResNet) with a different architecture (EfficientNet) and evaluate its impact on performance.

## Steps:

- Modify the code to load EfficientNet as the primary model.
- Retrain the model with the same dataset and hyperparameters.
- Compare the results with those obtained from ResNet.
